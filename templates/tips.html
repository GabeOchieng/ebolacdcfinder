	<h3><strong>Ebola prevention Tips<br /></strong></h3>
	<h4>Key Facts</h4>

<ul class="disc">
  	<li>Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. </li>
  	<li>The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.</li>
  	<li>The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.</li>
  	<li>The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the most recent outbreak in west Africa has involved major urban as well as rural areas.</li>
  	<li>Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation.  </li>
  	<li>Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralise the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development. </li>
  	<li>There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but 2 potential candidates are undergoing evaluation.</li>

<h4>Symptoms of Ebola include</h4><ul class="list-bullet"><li>Fever</li><li>Severe headache</li><li>Muscle pain</li><li>Weakness</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Abdominal (stomach) pain</li><li>Unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising)</li></ul><p>Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to Ebola, but the average is 8 to 10 days.</p><p>Recovery from Ebola depends on good supportive clinical care and the patient’s immune response. People who recover from Ebola infection develop antibodies that last for at least 10 years.</p>

<h4>Prevention</h4>
<p>If you travel to or are in an area affected by an Ebola outbreak, make sure to do the following:</p><ul><li>Practice careful hygiene. For example, wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoid contact with blood and body fluids.</li><li>Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).</li><li>Avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who has died from Ebola.</li><li>Avoid contact with bats and nonhuman primates or blood, fluids, and raw meat prepared from these animals.</li><li>Avoid hospitals in West Africa where Ebola patients are being treated. The U.S. embassy or consulate is often able to provide advice on facilities.</li><li>After you return, monitor your health for 21 days and seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola.</li></ul><br/><p>Healthcare workers who may be exposed to people with Ebola should follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Wear appropriate PPE.</li><li>Practice proper infection control and sterilization measures.</li><li>Isolate patients with Ebola from other patients.</li><li>Avoid direct contact with the bodies of people who have died from Ebola.</li><li>Notify health officials if you have had direct contact with the blood or body fluids, such as but not limited to, feces, saliva, urine, vomit, and semen of a person who is sick with Ebola. The virus can enter the body through broken skin or unprotected mucous membranes in, for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth</li></ul>
